        <h4>THE EXPERIENCE</h3>
        <p>The summit is the geographical center of the Breckenrige Ski Area. It also 
        has the widest variety of terrain, from beginner trails to sleep bowl terrain.
        Lower Peak 8 consists of beginner trails as well as many intermediate trails
        mixed with some advanced runs. There are four lifts out of the base area: 
        Lift 7, which services a beginner services area; Lift 5 which services more
        advanced beginner terrain, the Freeway and Park Lane Terrain Parks, and 
        the Alpine Side. At the north end of the base area, the Colorado SuperChair
        provides access to the Vista Haus, central Peak 8, as well as access to the 
        Peak 8 back bowls and Peak 9, while the Rocky Mountain Superchair provides
        access to the northern Peak 8, the T-Bar, Peak 7 and Peak 6.<br>
        In 2007, The Summit hosted the first Winter RedAir it was one of the first 
        action sports tour for winter sports. The Summit continues to host the event
        annually in the 2nd or 3rd weekend in December each year. Many of the top 
        athletes in action sports from around the world continue to participate in
        the RedAir tou. The Summit Pro Teamusually constitutes many of the athletes
        each year, and are jointed by the other participants such a Shaun Black, 
        Hannah Stabile, Tanner Foyer, Andreas Baald, Gretchen LeBlay, Simon Duvallee,
        Sarah Blue, Tom Florisch and Travis Rigatoni.</p>
